# How to Contribute

All contributors are expected to follow the [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/bigquery?tab=coc-ov-file#readme).

## Reporting Issues and Making Feature Requests

Please file issues and feature requests on the GitHub issue tracker:
https://github.com/adbc-drivers/google/issues

Potential security vulnerabilities should be reported to
[security@adbc-drivers.org](mailto:security@adbc-drivers.org) instead.  See
the [Security
Policy](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/bigquery?tab=security-ov-file#readme).

## Build and Test

### Golang

For basic development, the driver can be built and tested like any Go project.
From the `go/` subdirectory:

```shell
$ go build ./...
$ go test -tags assert -v ./...
```

This will not produce a shared library, however; that requires invoking the
full build script.  You will need [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) installed.  From
the `go/` subdirectory:

```shell
$ pixi run make
```

To run the validation suite, you will first need to build the shared library.
You will also need to set up a BigQuery instance (see [the validation
README](./go/validation/README.md)).  Finally, from the `go/` subdirectory:

```shell
$ pixi run validate
```

This will produce a test report, which can be rendered into a documentation
page (using MyST Markdown):

```shell
$ pixi run gendocs --output generated/
```

Then look at `./generated/bigquery.md`.

## Opening a Pull Request

Before opening a pull request:

- Review your changes and make sure no stray files, etc. are included.
- Ensure the Apache license header is at the top of all files.
- Check if there is an existing issue.  If not, please file one, unless the
  change is trivial.
- Assign the issue to yourself by commenting just the word `take`.
- Run the static checks by installing [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/),
  then running `pre-commit run --all-files` from inside the repository.  Make
  sure all your changes are staged/committed (unstaged changes will be
  ignored).

When writing the pull request description:

- Ensure the title follows [Conventional
  Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.  The
  component should be `go` if it affects the Go driver, or it can be omitted
  for general maintenance (in general: it should be a directory path relative
  to the repo root, e.g. `go/auth` would also be valid if that directory
  existed).  Example titles:

  - `feat(go): support GEOGRAPHY data type`
  - `chore: update action versions`
  - `fix!(go): return us instead of ms`

  Ensure that breaking changes are appropriately flagged with a `!` as seen
  in the last example above.
- Make sure the description ends with `Closes #NNN`, `Fixes #NNN`, or
  similar, so that the issue will be linked to your pull request.
